Dotfiles
========

This is my dotfiles repository.  It contains a few of my config
files for programs that run on Unix-ish systems.


Purpose
-------

This repository has several purposes:
  * Maintain one single location for config files I like to modify.
  * Track versions of config files.
  * Backup config files to Github.
  * Share dotfiles with the world.
  * Share dotfiles with myself (when I get a new account somewhere).


How I Use This Repository
-------------------------

Before I modify a program's config file, I make a hard link to it
inside my dotfiles repo, and commit the original file.  Then, I modify
the file and commit the changes.

If I want to modify it again, it is ofter easier to find the config
file inside my dotfiles repo than to figure out the path where the
program saved it (`$HOME`? `/usr/etc/`?).


How You Might Use This Repository
---------------------------------

The best way for you to use this repository is probably just to read
through it.  Hopefully, you will find one useful line somewhere, and
consider adding it to one of your own dotfiles.  (Careful: I have only
tested these files on OS X Lion (10.7.5).)
